DAY 1:

1. The base idea of machine learning is Neural Networks.
2. Simplest form of artificial Neural Networks is Perceptrons

    Perceptrons:

    Consists of:
        - Input Features
        - Weights
        - Bias
        - Activation


    1. Weights: Giving importance to different input neurons
    2. Bias: Helps shift the detection boundary away from the origin
    3. Activation: Decides when the neurons fire

    The Summation Function: This takes a wirghted sum of the input features
    
    The Backward Pass: a simple error function
    The aim is to get the loss of errors to a minima


3. Machine Learning Frameworks:
    - Frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow are built using C++ and hence are viably faster to use

4. Tensors:
    - They are n-dimensional arrays which are native to Pytorch and comee with built-in functions
    - They support parallel operations allowing GPU Computations
    - Splitting an image into color channels and representing each channel as a tensor
    - Convient data structure for performing complex mathematical calculation or transformations
